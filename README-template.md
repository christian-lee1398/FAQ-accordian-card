## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'd like to point out that the svgs on Frontend Mentor were positioned in a way that I could not figure out. Instead, I just staggered the images and kept them within the container div instead of the layering in the solution. 

I am also currently trying to find a way to unselect a link when you select a new one. As of right now, you can select all the links and the space gets crowded and unusable on smaller screens.


### Continued development

The logic used in this project (while the code may be messy) I will continue to use for future projects. There's always something to learn with JS, but additionally, I may also play with some more animations when clicking on a link so make the project pop more.
